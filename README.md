# Typing-Speed-Test
Python Mini Project

The speed typing test in the Python program measures how fast a user can type a given text. It accomplishes this by displaying a text prompt to the user and recording the amount of time the user spends typing the text. The program uses the time module in Python to record the start time and end time of the typing session.
This simple implementation provides a basic speed typing test and can be easily modified to include additional features, such as error checking, score calculation, or other customizations.
