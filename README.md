# CodeClause Typing Speed Test
This program is a typing speed test designed to test the typing speed of a user. The program presents the user with a prompt and measures how quickly and accurately the user can type the prompt.

## Requirements
This program requires the following modules to be installed in Python:

1. `tkinter`: This module is used to create the user interface for the typing speed test.
2. `random`: This module is used to generate random prompts for the user to type.
3. `time`: This module is used to measure the time taken by the user to type the prompt.


## How to Use
To use the typing speed test, simply run the CodeClause_Typing_Speed_Test.py file in your Python environment. The program will open a window with a prompt for the user to type. Once the user has typed the entire prompt, the program will display the time taken to type the prompt and the accuracy of the user's typing.

The user can then choose to take another typing speed test by clicking the "Take Another Test" button or exit the program by clicking the "Exit" button.


## Features
The typing speed test program has the following features:

1. Generates a random prompt for the user to type

2. Measures the time taken by the user to type the prompt

3. Calculates the accuracy of the user's typing

4. Displays the results of the typing test to the user

5. Allows the user to take multiple typing tests


## Future Improvements
Possible improvements for the typing speed test program include:

1. Adding different difficulty levels for prompts

2. Allowing the user to choose the length of the prompt

3. Saving the results of each typing test to a file for future analysis
